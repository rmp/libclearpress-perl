<h2>Working with Ajax</h2>

<p>
 If you're not sure
 what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>
 is, in a nutshell it's the ability to load chunks of content
 behind-the-scenes using javascript. There are many, many other
 resources out there to tell you all about it, so I'm not going to
 attempt to do that here.
</p>

<p>
 Using AJAX with ClearPress is pretty simple but we'll begin at the
 beginning. Let's assume you have a regular, non-AJAX-view for
 displaying information for a car manufacturer:

<code>package app::view::manufacturer;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base qw(ClearPress::view);

1;</code>

 This will use the default ClearPress <i>read</i> method and look for
 the <i>manufacturer_read.tt2</i> template on disk when serving the
 <i>/manufacturer/1</i> URI (for manufacturer 1 of course, and
 assuming you have a corresponding model with some data).
</p>

<p>
 Luckily making use of the basic AJAX built-in to ClearPress is just
 as simple. The ClearPress view superclass contains support for
 read_ajax. What we'd like to do is display cars for that manufacturer
 without loading each page separately. We'll make another view class:

<code>package app::view::car;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base qw(ClearPress::view);

1;</code>

</p>

<p>
 We'll import the most
 excellent <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library to take
 care of making our requests for us.

 In data/config.ini:
<code>[general]
jsfile=http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.1.min.js
</code>

and in the manufacturer_read.tt2 template we'll add this:

<code>&lt;ul&gt;
 [% FOREACH car = model.cars %]
  &lt;li&gt;
   &lt;a class="carlink" href="[% SCRIPT_NAME %]/car/[% car.id_car %]"&gt;
    [% car.name %]
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
 [% END %]
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="cartarget"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 $(document).ready(function(){
  $('a.carlink').click(function(){
   $('#cartarget').load(this.href);
   return false;
  }
 }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>

</p>

<p>
 So what we're saying here is that when the document has finished
 loading, look for all anchors with a class of <i>carlink</i> and
 configure each so that when it's clicked it loads the anchor target
 into the <i>cartarget</i> div.
</p>

<p>
 The eagle-eyed among you may have spotted that
 the <i>/car/&lt;id&gt;</i> page will normally load with full header
 &amp; footer decoration but ClearPress is smart enough to detect the
 request is an AJAX one and serves the content without decoration.
</p>

<p>
 The following <b>static</b> example demonstrates what this achieves.
